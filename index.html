                <h3>Who Is Ogerpon?</h3>
                <p>The land of Kitakami has passed down a tale as old as time; of an ogre who lives alone in a cave on Oni Mountain. One day, the ogre came down from the mountain in a terrible rage. Three Pokemon defended the village from the rampaging ogre and stole three masks that granted it power. Weakened and defeated, the ogre retreated back to the mountain, but the lives of the three Pokemon were lost.</p>

                <p>However, this is merely but a tale. Recently, it has been discovered that this version of history is FALSE and the truth had been covered up for centuries.</p>

                <h3>The Truth Of Ogerpon</h3>
                <p>The actual truth was that Ogerpon and its partner were kind travelers, hailing from a faraway village. However, their appearance caused them to be shunned by villagers and they took refuge on the mountains. A lone maskmaker took pity on the two, and crafted masks for the two to wear, so they could blend in and partake at the village festival.</p>
                <p>These masks the two donned were a marvel to behold, and word quickly spread across the land about the mysterious duo and their jewel encrested masks. Three greedy Pokemon caught wind of this, and travelled to the mountains to claim the masks for themselves.</p>
                <p>The man was attacked when the ogre went out for a walk, and the greedy Pokemon claimed all but one of the masks for themselves. When the ogre returned, she found that her partner had lost his life protecting one of the masks. With anger boiling up inside, Ogerpon donned the mask and sought vengeance against the three Pokemon.</p>

                <h3>The Decline of Ogerpon</h3>
                <p>The misunderstanding started when Ogerpon found the three Pokemon celebrating in the village down below, gloating about their victory and theft. Enraged, Ogerpon attacked the three Pokemon. The villagers, not understanding the situation, thought that the three Pokemon were defending the village. After they had lost their lives, they chased the oger out of the village, and erected a monument in honour of the three Pokemon, dubbing them as "The Loyal Three". From that day on, the greedy thieves were celebrated as heroes, while the oger was forced to live out her days in solitude, unwelcome, and went down in history as a menace.</p>
                <p>There was one who knew the truth, the mask maker who personally knew the traveller and Ogerpon. They tried to spread the truth, but the villagers dubbed them a heretic for speaking against The Loyal Three. As much as it pained the mask maker, they were forced to keep silent so that they could protect their family. The truth of the oger and the Loyal Three would be retold from generation to generation, but it would never leave the family, in fear that they too, would be ousted and dubbed heretics.</p>

                <h3>Who Is Ogerpon?</h3>
                <p>Now that the truth is revealed, allow us to give a glimpse as to the true nature of Ogerpon.</p>
                <p>Ogerpon is a Grass-type Pokemon that hails from a distant region. In battle, it attacks with a combination of devastating kicks and nimble movements. Outside of battle, it's a fun-loving Pokemon with a sense of curiosity. Due to its history of abuse, it's rather shy and meek to be around others, but once it warms up to you, it won't be afraid to show you a friendly smile and dance around happily.</p>
                <p>Its signature move is called "Ivy Cudgel", which changes the type of damage it does based on the mask that Ogerpon's wearing. Aside from it, it has other powerful moves such as Horn Leech, Superpower, and Power Whip at its disposal. Do not underestimate its defenses, however, as it can use Spiky Shield to protect itself and Counter to redirect any physical attacks to it. Don't get too close!</p>
